VichJmsIntegrationBundle
==================

VichJmsIntegrationBundle provides easy integration in Symfony2 between [VichUploaderBundle](https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle)
and [JMSSerializerBundle](https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSSerializerBundle) by creating two class annotations in order to generate
the file URL in the serialization event.
